### https://git-scm.com/video/what-is-git (8:15) Q2: What is a distributed version control system?
* Distributed version control system means that every member of the project has a complete copy of the project repository, including its full history, on their local machine. This allows them to work independently in their own "timeline," making changes and commits locally. Once they are ready, they can sync their changes with others by pushing their updates to a main/master branch, where everyone’s work is combined.
