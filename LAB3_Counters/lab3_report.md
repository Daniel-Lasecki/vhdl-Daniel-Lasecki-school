# LAB3 Report — Questions

Q1: What are the maximum values of ja, jb, int_a and int_b?


Q2: How many registers there are for counter signals int_a and int_b?


Q3: Explain where the registers come from.



Q4: What happens now when you run the simulation long enough?



Q5: What is the total number of registers and LUTs in the design? (Open utililization report, see below.)



Q6: Does the number of registers match with the register count in the elaborated design? If not, why?



Q7: Does the number of registers match with the utilization report?


Q8: What is the maximum value of ja and jb? Do these meet your expectations?



Q9: Did the amount of used resources change?



Q10: What is the maximum value of ja and jb? Do these meet your expectations?





Q11: Does the simulation pass now without erros?

Q12: What is the maximum value of jb?



Q13: What is the difference compared to previous?



Q14: what is the number of registers and LUTs? Does this meet your expectations?


Q15: Is the result expected?



Q16: What is the number of jb output register in the elaborated design schematics? Can you explain this?



Q17: How many registers/luts? Is the result expected?


Q18: Is this the optimal usage of registers? If not, why?

Q19: See the constraints file. What were the timing requirements for this design?

Q20: What is the set-up time margin? Try with 250MHz clock, does it still fulfil timing requirements?
